// class Human {
  // static String name = 'Mohsin';
  // int age = 26;
// }

// void main() {
  // print(Human.name); || we can access static member of a class directly instead of making it's instance
  // To get non-static member of a class we must make it's instance first
  // print(new Human().age);
// }

// NOTE:
// Rules for static methods are also same as static variables
